# Wetland Hydrologic Capacitance Model
The wetland hydrologic capacitance model (WHC) is a process-based wetland hydrology model that simulates the water balance for headwater catchments in wetland rich landscapes. It is composed of a lumped upland component and an individual wetland component. Model inputs include precip, PET, wetland morphology, and soils information. Various versions of the model have been used in [McLaughlin et al. 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2013WR015002/abstract), [Watts et al., 2015](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/683484), and [Jones et al. 2018](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.1744/abstract). Please contact Nate Jones (cnjones7@ua.edu) or Daniel McLaughlin (mclaugd@vt.edu) for more information about the model.

# Wetland_Hydrologic_Capacitance_Model
The wetland hydrologic capacitance model (WHC) is a process-based wetland hydrology model that simulates the water balance for headwater catchments in wetland rich landscapes. It is composed of a lumped upland component and individual wetland component. Model inputs include precip, PET, wetland morphology, and soils information. Various versions of the model have been used in McLaughlin et al., [2014], Watts et al., [2015], and Jones et al. [2018]. Please contact Nate Jones (njones@sesync.org) or Daniel McLaughlin (mclaugd@vt.edu) for more information about the model.
